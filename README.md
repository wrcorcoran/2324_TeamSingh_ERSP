<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
- Graph neural networks transform the nodes of a graph into a high dimensional latent space.

- This project will contrast the distances between nodes of a graph in the input space (graph structure) to their embedding in the latent space.

- Queries of interest will be finding node/subgraph outliers, and comparing representations produced by different deep learning methods.

- Project can be extended to consider different ways of reducing distortions in embeddings and measuring the local dimensionality of the embedding space.
