## Weekly Updates
### Week One

###### *Dates:* January 8-14, 2024

###### *Main Objective:* Begin to understand ArangoDB and OpenCypher codebase

#### Team Tasks:
1. ✅ Reorganize GitHub
2. Fork [OpenCypher](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher) and [ArangoDB](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb).
3. Setup Dockerfile so ArangoDB and OpenCypher will work on all machines. 
4. Beginning looking into documentation for each. 
5. Find CFG implementations in both codebases. 
6. Reach out to the teams of both and ask if they have the feature we are looking for. 

#### Individual Tasks:
1. Wyatt - research and understand CFGs

#### Accomplishments:
- January 10th: rearranged GitHub to be more friendly towards the year's project. Added space for research logs and key findings, glossary, etc.

#### Specific Questions:
- What is Gherkin? Encountered it while looking into the OpenCypher codebase.
